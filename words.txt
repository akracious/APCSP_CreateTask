Chris Jennings Dixon, an educator with experience at middle school, high school, and college levels, delves into the broader concept. “Writing is a way of putting your thinking on paper . . .” she says. “It helps move students to different levels of thinking. As teachers of college-level writing, we are trying to move our students toward what we believe is the epitome of good writing.” Dixon describes her recent endeavors as an attempt to develop “innovative approaches to improving student preparation for college writing.” The author of the upcoming NCTE book Lesson Plans for Teaching Writing, she was also the recent director of a national project, the Writing Coalition, funded by the U.S. Department of Education Fund for the Improvement of Postsecondary Education (FIPSE). Teachers in the FIPSE project explored the high school-to-college transition of language arts students. Along the way, the project led to the development of collaborative professional liaisons, high school writing centers, portfolio assessment techniques, and a myriad of teaching strategies.
